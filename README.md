# SystemCenter
Manager tool for managing configuration and metadata for OpenXDA, PQDashboard, OpenMIC, any future disturbance product, and other external processes (ie: Maximo, PQView, etc ). 

System Center includes information on a utility's grid assets in the form a pseudo model to minimize configuration effort.  
This model also allows openXDA analytics to be performed more reliably with the specification of secondary and tertiary voltage measurements on a substation bus.
